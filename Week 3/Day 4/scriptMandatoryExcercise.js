// Instructions

// Create a variable called sentence. The value of the variable should be a string that contains the words “not” and “bad”. For example, “The movie is not that bad, I like it”.
let sentence = ("this movie is not that bad, i like it");

// Create a variable called wordNot where it’s value is the first appearance of the substring “not” (from the sentence variable).

let wordNot = sentence.indexOf("not");
//console.log(wordNot);

// Create a variable called wordBad where it’s value is the first appearance of the substring “bad” (from the sentence variable).

let wordBad = sentence.indexOf("bad");

// If the word “bad” comes after the word “not”, you should replace the whole “not…bad” substring with “good”, then console.log the result.

let that = sentence.indexOf("not that bad");
let newStr = sentence.replace("not that bad", "good");
console.log(newStr);

// For example, the result here should be : “The movie is good, I like it”
